Research Gap: : 

* Kyriakou et al. (2022) looked into how highly structured landscape affects visual and verbal novelty, but they didn’t look into the specifics of visual novelty. Specifically, they didn’t examine whether the visual novelty is structural, functional or merely aesthetic novelty. 
* Existing research on augmented intelligence (Lee et al. 2022) examined how human-AI ( more alternatives ) can augment novelty, but it is not clear in what dimensions of the novelty does it augment? For example, in this piece of work, the authors argue that it augments humans’ abilities to use more diverse words, however does that lead to more novel stories/essays or merely just novelty in vocabularies?
